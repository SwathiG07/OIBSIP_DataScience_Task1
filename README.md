# Task 1: Iris Classification using Logistic Regression and SVM

## Objective
Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and preprocessed the Iris dataset.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Applied **Logistic Regression** to classify iris species.
4. Applied **SVM** with RBF kernel for classification.
5. Evaluated models using **accuracy score** and **classification report**.

## Tools / Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn (`LogisticRegression`, `SVC`, `accuracy_score`, `classification_report`)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## Outcome / Results
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** [97.78%]  
- **SVM Accuracy:** [97.78%]  
- Both Logistic Regression and SVM gave same accuracy  
- Classification reports show precision, recall, and F1-score for each iris class.
